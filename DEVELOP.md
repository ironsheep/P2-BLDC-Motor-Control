## Add Steering and Config Objects to your P2 Project

The objects provided by this project read a user configuration to determine how to cinfiugure themselves.  You'll first adjust this file to describe your setup.  Then you'll include the motor/steering objects you need into your top-level file.

Lastly you'll start the objects and then add your drive code and any sensor code you wish to use.

### Adjust config file to your desired configuration

Edit the user configuration file and adjust the settings to describe the configuration you will be using.

Here's the Author's two-wheel setup:

```
' -------------------------------------------------------------------
' AUTHORs  TEST configuration (dual Motor)
' -------------------------------------------------------------------
{
    ' using Mini Edge Breakout
    LEFT_MOTOR_BASE = PINS_P0_P15
    RIGHT_MOTOR_BASE = PINS_P16_P31

    DRIVE_VOLTAGE = PWR_12V

    MOTOR_DIA_IN_INCH = 6.5   ' 6.5 inches (floating point constant)
    
'}
```

You will need to configure one of:

- `ONLY_MOTOR_BASE` =  &nbsp; {pinBaseConstant}  &nbsp;  -OR-
- `LEFT_MOTOR_BASE` = &nbsp; {pinBaseConstant} and `RIGHT_MOTOR_BASE` = {pinBase}

and then set:

- `DRIVE_VOLTAGE` =  &nbsp; {voltageConstant}

as well as:

- `MOTOR_DIA_IN_INCH` = &nbsp; {wheelDiameterInInches}  (loating point value)

**NOTE:** *The constants you can use for {pinBaseConstant} and {voltageConstant} are provided in the file for you.*

Save your changes and you are ready to start adding the driver to your code.

### Include Project Objects

Yuu now need to select objects based on if you are a one-wheel or two-wheel confuration.

#### Using Two Motor Objects

- isp\_bldc\_motor_userconfig.spin2 - your configuration (motor connections, power, wheel size
- isp\_steering_2wheel.spin2 - the steering object which include the motor objects

You simply include them with something like:

```script
OBJ { Objects Used by this Object }

    user    :    "isp_bldc_motor_userconfig"     ' project motor, power configuration
    wheels  :    "isp_steering_2wheel"           ' steering and motor drivers and tracking
```

#### Start the Objects

Starting the wheels object in Spin2 is also pretty simple:

```script

PUB main() | eOpStatus, nIdx, nCollId, eRxQStatus, eCmdId, tmpVar

    ' start our motor drivers (left and right)
    wheels.start(wheels.PINS_P0_P15, wheels.PINS_P16_P31, wheels.PWR_12V)

    ' just don't draw current at stop
    wheels.holdAtStop(false)

  ... and do your app stuff from here on ...
  
   wheels.stop()   ' if you wish to shutdown COGs and release motor pins
   
```


#### Using A Single Motor Object

- isp\_bldc\_motor_userconfig.spin2 - your configuration (motor connections, power, wheel size
- isp\_bldc_motor.spin2 - the motor object which includes a single motor tracking object

You simply include them with something like:

```script
OBJ { Objects Used by this Object }

    user    :    "isp_bldc_motor_userconfig"     ' project motor, power configuration
    wheel   :    "isp_bldc_motor"                ' motor driver
```

#### Start the Objects

Starting the wheel and tracking objects in Spin2 is also pretty simple:

```script

PUB main() | motorCog, senseCog, basePin, voltage

    basePin := wheel.validBasePinForChoice(user.ONLY_MOTOR_BASE)
    voltage := wheel.validVoltageForChoice(user.DRIVE_VOLTAGE)

    if basePin <> wheel.INVALID_PIN_BASE and voltage <> wheel.INVALID_VOLTAGE
        ' start our single motor driver
        motorCog := wheel.start(basePin, voltage)
 
        ' for single motor let's start the single motor sense task
        senseCog := wheel.startSenseCog()

        ' just don't draw current at stop
        wheel.holdAtStop(false)

  ... and do your app stuff from here on ...
  
        wheel.stop()   ' if you wish to shutdown COGs and release motor pins
   
```


### And you're off!  Add your own motor control code

You are now at the `... and do your app stuff from here on ...` section of this page.
From here on, just use any of the Public Methods found in the [Steering and Motor control](DRIVE-OBJECTS.md) interface description.  

**Remember:** if you are two wheeled you are calling methods of the [**isp\_steering_2wheel.spin2**](https://github.com/ironsheep/P2-BLDC-Motor-Control/blob/main/DRIVE-OBJECTS.md#the-2-wheel-steering-object-public-interface) object `wheels.*` and if you are a single wheel then you are calling methods of the [**isp\_bldc_motor.spin2**](https://github.com/ironsheep/P2-BLDC-Motor-Control/blob/main/DRIVE-OBJECTS.md#the-motor-object-public-interface) object `wheel.*`.

Have Fun!
