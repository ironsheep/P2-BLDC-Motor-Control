### Drawing Files

These are the two design files I sent off to be make by [SendCutSend.com](https://sendcutsend.com/) - their prices are quite good!:

#### 1. Platform Board

[Drawing File - outboard wheels (.dwg)](DOCs/DesignFiles/EdgeMiniRoundV3b.dwg) - I spec'd 0.250" MDF as the material at ~$29 USD.

NOTE: the 8 center small holes (for M3 screws) are for mounting the twin motor boards connected to the **Mini Edge Breakout Board** (#64019) or the newer **Edge Breakout Board** (#64029).  The inner-most 4 holes are for the new, smaller RevB boards, while the outer four are for the larger RevA motor boards.

There are 2 ea. holes for each motor (for 1/4" - 20 Screws.)

There are 4 ea. holes for each castor - (for 1/4" - 20 Screws.)

There are 2 ea. holes for each spacer board (shim) (for 1/4" - 20 Screws.)

#### 2. Spacer Board

[Drawing File - spacer to drop motors below castors (.dwg)](DOCs/DesignFiles/SpacerV1.dwg) - I spec'd 0.025" MDF as the material w/Ten of these for ~$14.20 USD.</br>

### Packaging (order arrives)

This is what I found when I opened my order:

![Opened Package](images/unboxing-platform.jpg)
**The Package arrived with these contents..**  This was quite well packaged. The MDF part was shrink-wrapped to the backing cardboard. The laser cuts were all clean with a little bit of scorch mark on one side of the MDF as you might expect.
