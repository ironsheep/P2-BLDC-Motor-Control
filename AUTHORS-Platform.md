# P2-BLDC-Motor-Control - The Authors' Test Platform
as I work on these drivers I need to use a test platform.  This page describes what my platofrm looks like and how it is set up.

## Images of my Platform

I decided to use the inset wheels design (See [Drawings](DRAWINGS.md)) for mine and ordered it from [SendCutSend.com](https://sendcutsend.com/). I ordered a bunch of the spacers too. The order arrived like this:

You can see there are a number of predrilled holes for screws, castors, and cable feed through for the motor cables:

- The 4 center small holes (for M3 screws) are for mounting the twin motors boards connected to the Mini Edge Breakout Board. 
-  2 ea. holes for each motor (for 1/4" - 20 Screws.)
-  2x - 4 ea. holes for each castor - (for 1/4" - 20 Screws.)
-  2x - 2 ea. holes for each spacer board (shim) (for 1/4" - 20 Screws.)

After unboxing the parts need to be mounted:

The pencil marks show where I drilled additional holes as I determined what additional parts I needed to mount.

The finished platform looks like this:

Here are links to key parts I used:

- [HRB 5S 18.5V 5000mAh 50-100C RC Lipo Battery](https://www.amazon.com/HRB-5000mAh-50-100C-Battery-T-REX550/dp/B06XP7TY3S) - Amazon

- [DC 12v 24v to 5v Step Down Converter Regulator 5A 25W](https://www.amazon.com/Converter-Regulator-Adapter-Reducer-Electronics/dp/B07Q5W1BG3) - Amazon - Added Anderson power-pole connector on input side and N barrel plug on output side.
- [150A Power Analyzer, High Precision RC with Digital LCD Screen](https://www.amazon.com/ANKG-Precision-Measurement-Connectors-connected/dp/B07YF393ZH) - Amazon, LCD screen shows V, A, W, Ah, Wh measurements
- [Inline Blade-Fuse Holders](https://www.amazon.com/iGreely-Terminals-Connectors-Automotive-Compatible/dp/B07ST82H9H) - Amazon, Replaced ring-terminal ends with XT90 socket to mate with battery

**Castors** Special Note: the set screws tend to come lose with vibration. I was driving on gravel.  So use loctite or something similar to hold them in place if you don't want castors falling off as your are driving.

And here I'm running tests of the FlySky remote control demo. (Of course, running on the test-bench required an empty amazon box.   ;-)

Here's an updated bech-setup with the RPi in the drivers' seat!

![Now with RPi in drivers' seat](images/more-complex-hasRPi.JPG)

**NOTE:** the nVolt to 5V DC step-down supply was chosen so that I can power the P2 as well as the RPi from the same 5v. This picture shows me using a Y-splitter on the 5v with the two legs then feeding the P2 and the RPi.
